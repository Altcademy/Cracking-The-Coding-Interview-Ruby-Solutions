# 1.5 One Away
# There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings:
# insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character.
# Given two strings write a function that checks if the stings are
# one edit away form each other.

# The brute force would be to check all possible edits, but that would be too slow.

# The two strings will always be equal, or one char shorter or
# longer than each other if they are one edit away.

# removal is the inverse of insertion, you don't need to check both
